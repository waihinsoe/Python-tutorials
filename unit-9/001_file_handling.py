#File handling

#Read r has IO error if file isn't.

#Write w creates file and writes if file isn't.

#Append a similar to "write".

#open() will return file obj => need two paras ,file name and mode

### eg .form => filePointer = open("text.txt","r")

# r =>read
# rb => read with binary
# r+ => read write
# rb+ => read write with binary
